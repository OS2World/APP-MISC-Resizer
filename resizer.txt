Many thanks to Brad Barclay for all his help!

usage: resizer [<window title> [<multiplier>]]

Resizer is a very short program who's purpose is to change the size of other
program windows.  The need for this program came about when I started using
the SciTech Display Drivers to push my 19" monitor to 2048x1536.  I like to
play Entrepreneur, and it's normal window size was suddenly way to small.
Maximizing the window works, but there's way to many pixels to push when
running maximized on a 2048x1536 display.  Entrepreneur does not allow you
to arbitrarily resize it's window, so it would only show a 640x480 window
or a maximized window.

You can run Resizer from an OS/2 command prompt, or by setting up shadows
with the parameters already set up for the different windows you wish to
resize.  I currently have two shadows set up, one for doubling Entrepreneur
and one for doubling Hopkins FBI.

There are two parameters for resizer, window title and multiplier.  They
default to "Entrepreneur" and "2" if not passed.  The window title parameter
will match any title that starts with the same value, so "Hopkins" will match
the real window title of "Hopkins: FBI v1.0 for OS/2 Warp"
